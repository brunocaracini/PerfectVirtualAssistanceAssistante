# Perfect Virtual Attendance Assistant
Perfect attendance and a good night sleep, you don't have to choose anymore.

<h2> What does it do? </h2>
With the pandemic of covid-19 virtuallity became more common than we would like to, and classes were not the exception. And, sometimes, you don't feel like attending and listening to classes that are unusefull, specially when they are really early. But, until now, you had to, because of the attendance amount that you have to reach. With that on mind, and taking profit of the little advantages that this situation gave us, I created this project, wich is an automatiz Zoom conector, that enables you to set the time of your class, the Zoom meeting ID and password or the meeting link, and it will connect you automatically. Also, you can set up auto reconnection (in case that your professor do not have a Zoom premium account), every specific ammount of minutes. In ddition, you can also select if you want your computer to be suspended until the class, and if you want to reboot it or turn it down onceit's finished.

<h2> Development enviroment </h2>
